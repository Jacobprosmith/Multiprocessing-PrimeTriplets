Areas of Note within the Project:
While loop that will dynamically stop giving processes tasks when one of them has found the prime triplet.
Usage of rQueue and tQueue (multiprocessing.Queue()) to give tasks, and hand results back to a global primes list

Prime function used was given by teacher I take no credit of it.
